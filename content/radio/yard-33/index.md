A welcome reunion was had. After batting away some pesky technicals, the duo settled in to some deep and meditative 4-on-the-floor grooves. The pace slowly climbed while the drums veered off kilter. Scattered club liveners took things through to the crest of a wave, breaking into a modern day classic from J. Albert & Holodec to close proceedings gently. Tip!!!

Broadcast live from the yard in South London, 11th April 2024.
