It's a PlayStation 2 special, trying something a bit left to toast our 20th silly little show. For the first hour, listen to us try and make sense of a jumble of video-game music and relive our golden (?) years. In the second, rattling off club cuts at pace.

Broadcast live from home in South London, 27th October 2022.
