Back inna new year with a whole new Aaja slot and home. It happened to be Ewen's birthday who set pace with a tequila warmer and lime juice chaser to get the blood flowing. We spent most of this show slaloming between new record pick-ups and dusty old favourites, bringing in the softness of UK street soul and lovers rock ballads alongside some spaced out dub and rarified grime. Closed out with a likkle techno and dubstep flavours as the basement lights dimmed for the night to come.

Broadcast live from the Aaja Basement, Deptford, 22 Feb 2024.
