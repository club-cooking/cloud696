Real party, last-day-of-term vibes here. Ewen was getting hitched on radio day so a celebratory pre-record show was due. We kicked off on the chuggy, slowed-down woozy feels and ballads. Moved into a loose and springy house mood, peppered with weirdo vox. Closed with an assault of hi-NRG, BPM-crazed badness. Family affair!! Have a blast with this one <3

Pre-record broadcasted from the Aaja Basement, Deptford, 27 June 2024.
