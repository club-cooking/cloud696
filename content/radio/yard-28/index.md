The spread that Alex put on to keep the DJ troupe nourished for this one. Freshly sliced watermelon. Handmade, artisanal ginger tea. Years-old caramel Oreos. Miniature Green & Blacks chocolate that was going a bit white like the corner shop multipack off-cut variety. I think this variety of treats perfectly symbolised the mix that was. I'm talking out of my arse probably, but do you like fast and furious club styles with blends made on the front foot? Get into this one if that's u.

Broadcast live from home in South London, 28st September 2023.
