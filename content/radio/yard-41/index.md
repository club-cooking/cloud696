A bit of a throwback, this one. Toasting some records for the first 40 mins or so, plenty of dub echo and tape hiss bliss. The back end goes helter-skelter in no time, winding around delicate sub-bass and spacious club notes before tearing into some paranoid bleeps and levitating breaks to bring it home.

Broadcast live from the yard in South London, 3rd March 2025.
