Celebrating two years of the project on this show as well as reaching show #30. 
No big party just keeping in theme from previous 'milestone' shows and creating a special themed show. 
For this one we thought why not showcase some of the other musicac duos out there doing there thing. 
So this show is two hours of tracks strictly by musical duos.

Broadcast live from the yard in South London, 30th November 2023.
