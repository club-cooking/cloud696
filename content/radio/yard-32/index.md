This show crept up on the both of us! Started off going toe to toe with some deeeep sounds. 
Before moving into some more heavier tracks. Standout track of the show was from Ewen:
Kelela & KYRUH - Missed Call (KYRUH Remix). Didn't know Ewen had this kinda crud in his looker 
had dancing haaaard. Go give it a listen!

Broadcast live from the yard in South London, 14th March 2024.
