Bit of a wildcard edition, this one. Alex was busy on a Berlin field trip so Ewen took this opportunity to turn out an ecstatic, end-to-end thriller. UKG to techno slaloms for starters, grime and dubstep mutations for mains, and junglist-meets-footwork stacked up high for dessert. The world felt especially heavy this week so letting loose for a couple of hours felt good. Under no illusions about music actually helping solve real problems but maybe this can give someone a little break, at least.

Broadcast live from home in South London, 26th October 2023.
