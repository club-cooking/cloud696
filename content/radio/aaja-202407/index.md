A (for now) final broadcast from the basement for Cloud 696's fourth Thursday, previously second Friday, show on Aaja. Ewen managed to be late for such a pivotal episode but the duo would strike again with lovely bits across dub, house, soul, grime and Klein. Love to the listeners.

Broadcast live from the Aaja Basement, Deptford, 25 July 2024.
