We thought we'd see in spring with a trip through UKG and it's mutations. Some of these mutations were contraversial, someone may have attempted to coin the term "techno garage" during a particularly off-piste section of the show. Expect generous servings of rudeboy sub-bass, snappy hi-hats and sugary-sweet vocal lines alongside some regulation patter.

Broadcast live from home in South London, 30th March 2023.
