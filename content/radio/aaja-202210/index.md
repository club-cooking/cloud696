Enjoyed this one! A real game of two halves. Hard to pin down what the first hour was. Bits of wistful Aussie dreampop, some meditative dub, melodic jungle on a ragga tip. We worked the decks for most of the second hour, settling into a series of drum work-outs then bringing things back down with some new-school R&B crooning.

Broadcast live from the Snakepit, Deptford, 14th October 2022.
