Full squad for this one, first time in a little while and made for a real fun one. Started off proceedings with some low-strung scuzz and dub, into the outer realms of UK rap electronica, before getting into
the mix for a good chunk of the show. Plenty of dusty house workouts and some dub techno steppers, sprinkled with an Alex-sanctioned heavy stomper at the midway point and some giddy tempos to see us home. 

Broadcast live from the Aaja Basement, Deptford, 23 May 2024.
