Kept it on a chilled one mostly this week, 3 for 3 letting things play for the first half. Paying tribute to Astrud Gilberto before playing some new Nines,Lord Echo and Kassa Overall along with 
some repressed classics on Sould Jazz. Last hour we got into the mix mainly staying within the house realm. Was a fun show perfect for some peace and chill on a hot afternoon.
