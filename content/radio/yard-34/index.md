This session didn't have any chill. We made an impromptu decision to record it live from the Snakepit in Deptford, while Tania was intermittently going live on Insta. Heated table tennis matches were being contested in the background by the regulars. Cue a streak of heads-down 2 step, a meeting of ambient techno and deep house, the grime-techno hybrids heating up South London on a regular, ethereal Aleksi Perälä-type beats and a day one play of the new Skee Mask because we was feeling ourselves. Tune it and space out, you owe it to yourself.

Broadcast live from the Aaja Snakepit, 13th June 2024.
