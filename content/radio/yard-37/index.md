This episode is truly the product of sheer stubbornness and misplaced faith. First, it was a last minute decision from Ewen to go ahead solo dolo while Alex was AWOL. Thirty minutes to send up the bat signal on Insta, set up and fight a series of mythical technicals. The first track was frantically loaded up with seconds to spare, and away the lad went. Barely half an hour into proceedings, the only pair of headphones in the gaff decided to give up the ghost. The next 90 minutes went something like that scene in Star Wars where Luke is blind-folded and Yoda is on his back, hitting him with a stick. From somewhere deep, things came back from the brink, as if ancestral DJs were pulling the strings and guiding this young pretender towards blends sent from the most high. Pretty much everything inside here was plucked from years gone by, cream that rose to the top as they say. Tip!!!

Broadcast live from the yard in South London, 12th September 2024.
