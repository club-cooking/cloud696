Ewen going in solo on this one, while Alex does his ting in Accra. At least a few tracks with spring in the name to toast the equinox. A soulful footwork/DnB section comes out of nowhere. Dusty house jams on wax sprinkled all over the second half. Taking absolute liberties with structure and form but having fun while we do it. Rocked one wet sock for most of it (need to get some new treads badly), verified mood lifter.

Broadcast live from the Aaja Basement, Deptford, 28 March 2024.
