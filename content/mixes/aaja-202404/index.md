Another solo show  with Alex holding things down for this one, while Ewen was galavanting in Peru. Something for everyone over this 2 hours.
Some spaced out electronic sounds before moving into some dub and a weighty bass mix section. Some old skl NY Rap bits too. AAJA crew was feeling it, i'm sure you will and all!

Broadcast live from the Aaja Basement, Deptford, 25 April 2024.
