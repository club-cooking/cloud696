Like the majority of us, we are quite disgruntled (understatement) with whats going on in the UK atm. This show  was a
two-hour slice of radio dedicated to contemporary (2000ish to present) protest music made in the UK. 
Both overt and abstract, anthems and album cuts, aggressive and peaceful. 
Anything that speaks with feeling, on some level, to dissatisfaction with the status quo on our cruddy little island
