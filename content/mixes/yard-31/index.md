First dose of yard radio for the year and after a short hiatus we had to start it off cruddy. Not much chat but 2 hours of us finding the half spaces between Grime and Techno. Some proper weighty tracks in here, wont spoil the tracklist just have a listen!

Broadcast live from the yard in South London, 8th February 2024.
