Alex finally got hold of some new 7" woofers and this episode is their official yard christening. We rolled thru indulgent villalobos remixes, modern + dusty midwestern house, next generation M-plant rollers, sugary vocal garage, spacious techno with dubstep sensibilities from Bristol + beyond, yet another toe-curling Karenn joint and funky flavours from London town.
Enjoy the ting!

Broadcast live from home in South London, 29th June 2023.
