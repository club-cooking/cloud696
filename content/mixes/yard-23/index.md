We took January off so this was our first home recording of the year. The tech gods had Alex in a chokehold strong, both the lappy and USB gave up the ghost the night before. Pure grit brought this man back from the brink with a fresh USB packing heat for the people. We FINALLY got a proper mic stand so look forward to some rich-sounding mumbles and questionable pronunciations. In all seriousness this was one of our favourite shows we've put together so far, got deep and wide in our techno/grime/wonky bag and kept the energy levels flowing for two hours solid. Mixcloud tried it's best to keep this slice of goodness off the web for a little bit but it's here now. Tuck in bruv.

Broadcast live from home in South London, 23rd February 2023.
